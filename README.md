# Python Projects - Intermediate
Welcome to my Python repository for Dev128 - Python II.<br/> 
Each project focuses on different aspects of Python, from basic scripts to more complex algorithms.


# Skills
Upon completion of this course, I understand how to:<br/>

• Use advanced datatypes including Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries<br/>
• Use Exception Handling appropriately.<br/>
• Create classes that encapsulate application functionality and provide appropriate public members.<br/>
• Use inheritance in applications.<br/>
• Describe and make use of polymorphism.<br/>
• Use classes to create an N Tier application structure.<br/>
• Create a simple Database application.<br/>
• Create a simple GUI application.
